You're done!

- Clone your own repository
- Start writing
- Push to your repository whenever you like to.

**This is the magic** that will happen:

- The server will pull the changes and do a fresh rendering within five
  minutes.

- whenever you push to your Github repository Github will notify the 
  docs.typo3.org server.

- Visit the '\_make' folder of your documentationen to find out if there
  have been any warnings or errors. For example: See the
  `_make folder of this manual`__
